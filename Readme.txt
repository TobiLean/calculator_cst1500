This calculator was made by https://github.com/Ferfer8 and https://github.com/TobiLean. It is a calculator made with python using the tkinter library for it's gui.

Instructions:
- Type in numbers and operands as you would on a normal calculator, using either your keyboard or mouse to select on the app.
- Clicking c on your keyboard clears the calculator screen for new operations
- To perform trigonometric operations like sin and cos, type the number/values you wish to operate on, the trig function and then equals to. (This is the same procedure for other scientific operations on the calculator)

Improvments:
- The calculator's history does not work (it writes but does not display the saved results).
- The clear button on the claculator gui doesn't always work as intended, it clears but you only see the result if you type again after clicking the clear button.
- Backspace does not function as backspace, instead it hides the previous character and a new character is inputed it unhides it.
- There is no memory, so you cannot go back to previous equations.
